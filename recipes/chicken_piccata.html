              <li>all-purpose flour for dredging</li>
              <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
              <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
              <li>½ cup white wine</li>
              <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
              <li>¼ cup water</li>
              <li>3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/4-inch slices</li>
              <li>2 tablespoons fresh Italian parsley, chopped</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 id="heading4"><u>Steps</u></h4>
          <ol>
              <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap and pound to about 1/2-inch thick.</li>
              <li>Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly 
                  in flour and shake off any excess.</li>
              <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, 
                  and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.</li>
                  <li>Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed though, 
                      about 30 seconds.</li>
                      <li>Pour white wine into skillet. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
                           Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes</li>
                           <li>Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; 
                               cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. 
                               Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.</li>
                               <li>Return chicken breasts to the pan cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.</li>
